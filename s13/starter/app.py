Streamlit chat UI for WealthDesk — Bharat National Bank's AI wealth assistant.

Session 13: Streamlit Frontend + Human-in-the-Loop.

Architecture:
  - Streamlit chat interface wraps the S12 multi-agent graph (one small change in nodes.py
    adds the optional streaming hook — see _stream_callback below)
  - Every query passes through: Supervisor → [Documents|Rates|Escalate|Decline] → Compliance Agent
  - Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): when the Compliance Agent revises a response,
    the operator sees the revised text and must approve or discard before it
    is shown to the customer.

Run:
    streamlit run app.py   (from inside s13/solution/)

--- HOW TO ADAPT FOR YOUR LAUNCHPAD PROJECT ---
1. Add `_stream_callback = None` to your nodes.py and call it inside your respond node's
   llm.stream() loop (see wealthdesk/nodes.py for the exact pattern).
2. Replace build_graph() with your own agent's build_graph().
3. Update build_input_state() to match your agent's state keys.
4. Update needs_human_review() to match your own review trigger condition.
5. Update format_route_label() to reflect your agent's routing fields.
6. The HITL and session-state patterns below work as-is.

# S13: Token streaming — bridges llm.stream() in nodes.py to the Streamlit UI
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

class _StreamingState:
    """Receives tokens from nodes.py via _nodes._stream_callback and renders
    them incrementally into a Streamlit placeholder.

    HOW IT WORKS:
      nodes.py has a module-level variable `_stream_callback = None`.
      When we set it to an instance of this class, the respond node in nodes.py
      calls it with each token as it arrives from llm.stream().
      This class accumulates the tokens and updates the Streamlit placeholder
      on every call, creating a typewriter effect.

    HOW TO USE IN YOUR PROJECT:
      1. Add `_stream_callback = None` to your nodes.py module level.
      2. In your respond node, loop over llm.stream() and call _stream_callback(token).
      3. In app.py, set _nodes._stream_callback = _StreamingState(placeholder) before
         graph.invoke(), then set it back to None after.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY PURE FUNCTIONS?
# Streamlit calls are not testable with plain pytest. By extracting all logic
# that doesn't need Streamlit into these 5 functions, we can write unit tests
# (see s13/tests/) without running a Streamlit server.
# Rule: if a function calls st.something(), it cannot be in this section.

      history.

    WHY MemorySaver + uuid4:
      MemorySaver keeps conversation history in RAM, scoped to this Python process.
      Each browser tab gets a different uuid4 thread_id, so two tabs don't
      share memory. On page refresh, session_state is cleared and a new
      uuid4 is generated — intentionally starting a fresh conversation.

    FOR YOUR PROJECT:
      Replace MemorySaver with SqliteSaver if you need history to survive
      server restarts, or RedisCheckpointSaver for multi-instance deployments.
